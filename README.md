## Description of projects working on

<p>
    I have been working through the projects on Frontend Mentor website to practice my skills and following a website design. This is quite a challenge, as I am only working from the free jpg images. Which means I have to use other methods to try and guess the layout  sizes. E.g. widths, heights, paddings & margins etc...
